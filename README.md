# EM-Field-Detector-using-OP-AMP
This is a very simple circuit which was used to detect the Electromagnetic field which was around us. The principle behind this circuit was mutual induction whenever a EMF was near a inductor mutual inductance takes place and due to this mutual induction it results in a voltage in the inductor. Using this induced voltage the EMF field was detected. Lets see the working of emf sensor circuit.

# Principle
The root principle of detection of the EM wave or presence of EM wave is to detect the corresponding changes happening in the either magnetic field or electric field or both at the place where we want to measure. Here in our project we have applied the principle of Mutual Induction (change in flux of a coil). We have tried to detect the changes happening in the magnetic flux due to external strong filed created by the device which is working on the application of EM wave. The contact of the electromagnetic field causes the value of the electrolytes to change due to the presence of tolerance. In the inductor, to store more energy the current through it must increase. Consequently, the magnetic field through it is increased.

# TL072
The TL07xx JFET-input operational amplifiers incorporate well-matched, high-voltage JFET and bipolar transistors in a monolithic integrated circuit. The devices feature high slew rates, low-input bias and offset currents, and low offsetvoltage temperature coefficient. The low harmonic distortion and low noise make the TL07x series ideally suited for high-fidelity and audio pre-amplifier applications. The TL071 device has offset pins to support external input offset correction. It has wide common and differential voltage range.

Features
- Low Total Harmonic Distortion: 0.003% (Typical)
- Low Noise Vn = 18 nV/√Hz (Typical) at f = 1 kHz
- High Slew Rate: 13 V/μs (Typical)
- Common-Mode Input Voltage Range Includes VCC+

# LM358
The LM358 series consists of two independent, high gain, internally frequency compensated operational amplifiers which were designed specifically to operate from a single power supply over a wide range of voltages. Operation from split power supplies is also possible and the low power supply current drain is independent of the magnitude of the power supply voltage. Application areas include transducer amplifiers, dc gain blocks and all the conventional op amp circuits which now can be more easily implemented in single power supply systems. For example, the LM358 series can be directly operated from the standard +5V power supply voltage which is used in digital systems and will easily provide the required interface electronics without requiring an additional ±15V power supply.

Feature:
- Short Circuit Protected Outputs
- True Differential Input Stage
- Single Supply Operation: 3.0 V to 32 V
- Low Input Bias Currents
- Internally Compensated
- Common Mode Range Extends to Negative Supply
